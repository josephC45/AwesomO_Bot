# Project Status:
Still in development.


# Description:
The AWESOM-O bot is an all purpose Discord bot that will be used for monitoring chat, and completing basic commands for its members.

    
## How to run bot:
Once you have the bot cloned to your pc, you must change the token for your channel so the bot may connect to that respective server/guild.
After that is complete, redirect to the .py file location in your shell and type: 
```bash
python bot.py
```

## Important Commands:
    !commands
        Shows all of the available commands.
    !botlogoff
        Logs AWESOM-O bot off of discord.
        Only the individuals holding administrative privledges are allowed to run this command.

## Command prefix:
Commands are prefaced with a **!** followed by the specified command.
It is important to note that all commands and arguments contain **no** spaces.

    For example:
        To create a text channel, you run:
            !createtextchannel categoryname desiredtextname
        Not:
            !createtextchannel desiredtextname
