# Description:
    The AWESOM-O bot is a all purpose bot used for monitoring chat,
    and completing basic commands for its members.
    
## How to run bot:
    Once you have the bot cloned to your pc, you must change the token for your channel so the bot may connect to that respective server/guild

    Once that is complete, redirect to the .py file location in your shell and type, "python *filename*.py"

### Command prefix:
    Commands are prefaced with a "!" followed by the specified command.
    It is important to note that all commands and argument contain **no** spaces.

        For example:
            To create a text channel, you run...
                "!createtextchannel categoryname desiredtextname"
            Not:
                "!createtextchannel desiredtextname"
